***NOTE*** - It is ***INCREDIBLY*** important to remember to not just blindly execute everything you find off the internet. It can be just as dangerous for us as it can be for a client.  Don't run anything that you don' fully understand what it does.

# Searching for exploits

## online resources
- #ExploitDB - maintained by Offesnive Security.  Updates to ExploitDB are announced through twitter/RSS feed.
- SecurityFocus Exploit Archives - focuses on a few key areas : 
	- BugTraq
	- SecurityFocus Vulnerability DB
	- SecurityFocus Mailing Lists
- #PacketStorm - up-to-date security news and vulns as well as recently published tools by vendors
- Google Search Operators - "SW and version" + *exploit* keyword.  There is a LOT of goodness on Github..... but again, don't run anything that you don't fully understand

## offline resources
- ExploitDB (**apt update && apt install exploitdb**).  Will be located under **/usr/share/exploitdb/** and split into two primary sections : **exploits** and **shellcodes**. Using the **searchsploit** functionality from the commandline allows you to facilitate  searching throught the MASSIVE ExploitDB.
- Nmap #NSE scripts -- can be easily searched through leveraging **grep** (**grep Exploits ``*.nse``**).  Again, located at **/usr/share/nmap/scripts**.
- Browser Exploitation Framework ( #BeEF) - pentesting tool focused on client-side attacks executed within the browser. accessed using the **sudo beef** command.
- Metasploit (**msfconsole**)
