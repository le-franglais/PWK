# How they work
Use SW versions as well as *signature-matching* to discover vulnerabilities. Automated scanners tend to generate quite a few false positives and, more dangerously, false negatives.  Manual review ***MUST*** be a part of any vulnerability scanner usage.

## Internal scanning versus internet scanning considerations
network placement can affect speed of scan, access rights, traffic interference, and target visibility

## Authenticated vs. unauthenticated
Windows authentication gneerally requires the **Windows Management Instrumentation** (**WMI**) along with creds and remote management perms.

# Vuln scanning with Nessus
Free and enterprise models 
Primary scan types include : 
- Basic network scan 
- Credentialed patch audit (authenticated)
- WebApp Tests (*published* vulnerabilities)
- Spectre and Meltdown

# Vuln scanning with Nmap
Written in Lua, and powerful as a scanner.  Multiple categories for the scripts (notably, "vuln" and "exploit" -- and within those "safe" and "intrusive").
- **script.db** file is a repository that serves as an inde to all of the scripts (This file is *greppable*)
