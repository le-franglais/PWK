Used when time doesn't allow for devving out an exploit but also doesn't allow for finding the exact, perfect exploit.  This may involve porting an exploit to a different language or a different OS.

# Fixing memory corruption exploits
First thing is to understand the general flow of a standard stack overflow : 
1. Create a large buffer to trigger the overflow
2. Take control of the #EIP by overwriting a return address on the stack by padding the large buffer with an appropriate #offset
3. Include a chosn payload in the buffer prepended by an optional #NOP sled
4. Choose a correct return address instruction such as #JMP #ESP (or different register) to redirect the executoin flow into our payload.
***NOTE*** : We must always consider changing the payload contained in the original exploit code to avoid having to reverse-engineer the code to understand it

## Importing and examining the exploit
Differences between scripting languages and compiled languages.
- Scripting languages are executed through an interpreter and not compiled to create a stand-alone executable.
	- *Side Note* - because scripting languages require an interpreter, you can not run a script in an environment where that language is not installed.
- String concatenation is VERY easy in scripting languages, but doing so in that way is not allowed in a programming language such as C.

Cross-compiling exploit code
There are situations where we only have access to a single attack environment, but need to leverage an exploit that is coded for a different platform.
- *mingw-64* is an extremely popular cross-compiler.  **sudo apt install mingw-64**
1. #Compile the code initlally to see if the exploit code compiles wihtout errors.
2. Changing the socket information
3. Change the return address of the exploit if the original code points to an address that isn't part of the vulnerable software.  
4. Changing the payload. 
	1. To try to run a cross-compiled exploit for Windows on Linux, you'll need to use **wine**, which is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows apps on several OSs.
5. Changing the BOF 

# Fixing web exploits 
## Considerations
- Does it initiate an HTTP or HTTPS connection ?
- Does it acces sa webapp specific path or route ?
- Does the exploit leverage a pre-authentication vuln ?
- If not, how does the exploit authenticate to the webapp ?
- How are the GET or POST requests crafted to trigger and exploit the vuln ?
- Does it rely on default app settings that may have been changed after installation ?
- Will oddities such as self-signed certs disrupt the exploit ?
### Steps 
1. Changing the connectivity info (URLs, credentials, connection parameters, etc.)
2. Troubleshooting errors
